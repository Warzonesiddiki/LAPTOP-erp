# Gap Analysis v1.0

Baseline: Roadmap requirements list (provided in prompt).

## Detected Gaps (UI/Settings/Reports)
1) Reports page lacks explicit export format options (Excel/CSV/JSON) and print actions in UI.
2) Settings page lacks date format configuration field.
3) Settings page lacks technician rate configuration (beyond default labor rate).
4) Accessibility skip link missing in app shell.
5) Settings UI not aligned to cyberpunk theme (visual consistency gap).
6) Reports UI not aligned to cyberpunk theme (visual consistency gap).
7) Loading/Error screens not aligned to cyberpunk theme (visual consistency gap).

## Planned Fixes (Phase 2)
- Add export format buttons and print actions on Reports page.
- Add date format and technician rate configuration to Settings.
- Add skip link in Layout for keyboard navigation.
- Apply cyberpunk styling to Reports, Settings, and Loading/Error screens.

## Notes
- All missing gaps are UX-level and do not change business logic or accounting correctness.
